## Guide

In order to run the application, you need to have python installed in your computer.

For this project I am using python 3.8 and an anaconda environment

## Step by step:
1. Open CMD (command prompt)
2. type "conda create -n StephenMiniWallet python=3.8
3. conda activate StephenMiniWallet
4. conda install pip
5. pip install -r requirements.txt
6. python manage.py migrate
7. python manage.py runserver

-----
## Now you should be able to use the API and the endpoints required

### Notes:
- I did not implement too much validation in terms of 
security because of time limit.
